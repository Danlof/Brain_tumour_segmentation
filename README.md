# Brain_tumour_segmentation

This will be my progress traccker of what i have done in the project:
-the data contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
- More information of the data can be found here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation/data
